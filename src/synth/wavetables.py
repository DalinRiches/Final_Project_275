class wavetable:

    #TODO: Get wave table's from WAV files - this allows umlimited possibilites
    #        will also make it so we don't have to type 700,000 numbers
    #        will also allow the use of seperate wave tables for each octave
    #           -Prevents nasty aliasing at high frequency's
